# Security Policy

This document includes information about the vulnerability reporting, patch,
release, and disclosure processes, as well as general security posture.

# Reporting Security Issues

Vulnerabilities are reported privately via GitHub's
[Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories)
feature. Please use the following link to submit your vulnerability:
[Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/coreruleset/go-ftw/security/advisories/new)

Please see
[Privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
for more information on how to submit a vulnerability using GitHub's interface.

Our vulnerability management team will respond within 3 working days of your
email. If the issue is confirmed as a vulnerability, we will open a
Security Advisory and acknowledge your contributions as part of it. This project
follows a 90 day disclosure timeline.
